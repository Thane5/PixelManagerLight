# PixelManager
## Original Readme by Joegenco:


Tries to manage pixels colors

Now it's completely overhauled using EaryChows AgX config as a basis.
Has not been tested extensively, there will be bugs.

Readme coming soonâ„¢.

## My Fork:
No big changes, all i did is switch to a "minimal" preset for inactive_colorspaces which already existed in the config. 

This makes the color space dropdown much more compact.
