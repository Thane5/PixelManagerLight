# PixelManager
## Original Readme by Joegenco:


Tries to manage pixels colors

Now it's completely overhauled using EaryChows AgX config as a basis.
Has not been tested extensively, there will be bugs.

Readme coming soonâ„¢.

## My Fork:
I removed a bunch of color spaces to make the drop down menu more compact and easier to read.
